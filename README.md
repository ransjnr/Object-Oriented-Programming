# Object-Oriented-Programming in C++

Being an object-oriented programming language, C++ uses objects to model real-world problems

Unlike procedural programming, where functions are written to perform operations on data, OOP involves creating objects that contain both data and functions.

An object has two characteristics: attributes and behavior. For example, a car can be an object. And, it has

attributes - brand, model, size, mileage, etc.
behavior - driving, acceleration, parking, etc.
